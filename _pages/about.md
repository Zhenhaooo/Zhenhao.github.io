I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.wh.sdu.edu.cn/), [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm). My research interest includes Autonomous Driving, Reinforce Learning, and Deep Learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiang Bin](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/jiangbin) of ChiYun Lab from [School of Mechanical, Electrical & Information Engineering](), Shandong University.
